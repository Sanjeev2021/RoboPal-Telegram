As you can see the bot is working fantastically without any issues.
It's truly a master piece. Ok, now let us see how this fantastic
piece of software works.

## How it works

This chatbot works by using openAI API. This is written in python
and calls the API with the user's input. The model we use for the
API is designed to be user friendly and suitable for every user.
The model we are using for the API:

After we call the API we get a response in return which we then
in the form of text return back to the user. 

Robopal also works in groups, you can start the message by tagging
her and it'll work the same.

The telegram API allows us to handle messages, send messages, 
recieve bot commands.
